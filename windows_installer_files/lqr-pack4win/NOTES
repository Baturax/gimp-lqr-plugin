The winpack.sh script in this directory is used to compile
the GIMP Liquid Rescale Plug-In on Windows and to prepare
the creation of a Windows installer with NSIS.

It is meant to be run under MinGW/MSYS. It needs to find
liblqr and GIMP already compiled under MinGW.

Most parameters (e.g. version numbers, installation
locations, user names etc.) need to be adjusted by hand, by
editing the script.

If successful, it creates a directory structure under
$DESKTOP/LqR_installer, which can be used by the NSIS
configuration script gimp-lqr-plugin-installer.nsi.
